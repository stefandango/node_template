# Stefandango.dev NODE.JS template

My own node.js playground template. 

A tiny MVC pattern build using handlebars and webpack to bundle files together. 
Controllers serve handlebar files as well as JavaScript per view. Styling is done using SASS.
All files are bundles using webpack.

## Running Project

Project requires node and npm installed. 

* Clone Project
* Create a ".env" file with PORT set:
```
PORT=3000
```
* Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
* Start project using NPM 
```
npm run start
```

* Site should now run on localhost:3000 or whatever port entered in the .env file.
